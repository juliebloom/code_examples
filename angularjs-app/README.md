# Rover Coding Project

The goal of this project is to create a simple page showing a list of dogs, with the ability to find out more about each dog. Please feel free to design the interface as you see fit - there is no one design we're looking for, but we'd like to get a sense of your design sensibilities.

While this project itself is simple, we're not just looking to see if you can complete the project. Please take your time and show us what you care about when you're writing software. The work you create here should be representative of code that we'd expect to receive from you if you were hired tomorrow.


### Requirements

Create a single web page for website that lists dogs and some information about them, using the following specification:

1. Fetch the collection of dogs at http://interview.rover.com/dogs.json.

2. The JSON object will contain a number of dog objects, one for each dog. In a grid on the page, display the avatar image and name of the dog.

3. For each dog display a "more details" link, so that the user can view more details about a dog.

4. When the user clicks on a dog in the grid, show a modal dialog with all of the dog information
  - The dog's name
  - The dog owner's name and city
  - The dog avatar

5. The page should include a control to toggle the list between grid mode and list mode.

6. Allow a user to live-filter the list of dogs with a search bar. For example, when a user types 'Fid', it should show the dog 'Fido', as well as a dog with the owner 'Fidalgo', and any dogs living in the city 'Fidelia'


Complete this project and push your solution back to this repository. When you're finished up, email your Rover contact and let them know.
